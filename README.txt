1. Walk us through the design of your project. Why did you design your project the way you did? 
What difficulties did you overcome?

Initially, I tried writing js code only using fs and path. I got close to the expected
results but not quite. Then I used the npm module that was suggested in the homework
assignment, csv-to-json, and within a few minutes it was working. My only challenge was 
realizing that I had to change the field-delimiter from ';' to ','.

2. How did you test your project to verify that it works? 

I ran my code and it provided the output file with the data in the proper format.

3. Let us know if anything doesn't work as intended so your reviewer will know ahead of time.

I believe everything worked as expected.

Thanks, Ron
